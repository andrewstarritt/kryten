 *
 * EPICS buffered callback module for use with Ada, Lazarus and other runtime
 * environments which don't like alien threads. It also provides a buffering
 * mechanism that can be useful even in native C applications.
 *
 * This module provides three functions:
 *
 *   void buffered_connection_handler (struct connection_handler_args args);
 *   void buffered_event_handler (struct event_handler_args args);
 *   int  buffered_printf_handler (const char *pformat, va_list args);
 *
 * These handers functions are not intended to be called directly by the user
 * program, but instead passed as the callback parameter to the relevent
 * functions within the ca library.  Example:
 *
 *  status = ca_array_get_callback (DBR_CTRL_FLOAT, 1, channel_id,
 *                                  buffered_event_handler, NULL);
 *
 * The buffered_xxx_handler functions store a copy of the callback data on a
 * queue. When process_buffered_callbacks is invoked it removes the data from
 * the queue and calls application_xxx_handler, where xxx is one of connection
 * event or printf. The queue is mutex protected.
 *
 * NOTE: There is ONE queue. If the application is running multiple contexts,
 * then the application_xxx_handler functions must manage the re-direct the
 * response to the appropriate context.
 *
 * The application_connection_handler, the application_event_handler and the
 * application_printf_handler functions must be declared in the user program
 * and made available to the "C" world.
 *
 * Examples:
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * For Ada, the event call back should look something like:
 *
 *    procedure Ada_Event_Handler
 *        (Args : in Channel_Access_Api.Ca_Event_Handler_Args);
 *
 *    pragma Export (C, Ada_Event_Handler, "application_event_handler");
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * For Lazarus Pascal, the connection handler would as follows. Note, while
 * Pascal is usually case insensitive with respect to procedure names, the
 * case of the procedure name IS significant here.
 *
 *   procedure application_connection_handler
 *               (Args : ca_Connection_Handler_Arg_Ptrs); cdecl; export;
 *   begin .... end;
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * For C++, one would need this or similar:
 *
 *    extern "C" {
 *       void application_connection_handler (struct connection_handler_args *args);
 *       void application_event_handler (struct event_handler_args *args);
 *       void application_printf_handler (char *formated_text);
 *    }
 *
 *    void application_connection_handler (struct connection_handler_args *args) { .... }
 *    void application_event_handler (struct event_handler_args *args) { .... }
 *    void application_printf_handler (char *formated_text) { .... }
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NOTE: To aid binding and callback processing in other languages, the
 * buffered callback APIs differs slightly from the native EPICS callback APIs.
 *
 * For the event and connection callback handlers, a pointer to the
 * connection_handler_args or event_handler_args structure is passed the
 * application handler function, not a copy of the structure.
 *
 * For the printf handler, this unit uses vsprintf to convert the format and
 * va_list args parameters into a plain string.
