    "configuration-file\n"
    "    Specifies the file that defines the PVs to be monitored together with\n"
    "    match critera and the system command to be called.\n"
    "\n"
    "    The expected file format is as follows. Blank lines and lines starting\n"
    "    with a # character are ignored, the later being useful for comments.\n"
    "    Otherwise the line consists of fields. Fields are separated by white\n"
    "    space (spaces and/or tabs) with optional leading and tailing white space.\n"
    "\n"
    "    The first field is the PV name. For waveform records and other array PVs,\n"
    "    the PV name may be immediatly followed by an array element number enclosed\n"
    "    in square brackets. The default is '[1]'.\n"
    "    Note: %skryten%s array indexing starts from 1.\n"
    "\n"
    "    The second field is the match criteria. This consists of upto 16 sub\n"
    "    -match criteria seprated by a | character. Each sub field consists of\n"
    "    a single value or a pair of values, sepratated by a ~ character, that\n"
    "    specifies an inclusive range of match values.\n"
    "\n"
    "    The values may be a string, an integer or a floating value. The type of\n"
    "    the first match value determines the Channel Access request field type:\n"

    "        String    DBF_STRING\n"
    "        Integer   DBF_LONG\n"
    "        Floating  DBF_DOUBLE\n"
    "\n"
    "    It is therefore important that a range of values, say for a pump, be\n"
    "    specified as 2.0~6.25 as opposed to 2~6.25, as the latter will cause the\n"
    "    subscription of DBF_LONG values from the IOC, yielding, for example, a\n"
    "    returned value of 6 when the true value is 6.45, thus leading to an\n"
    "    erroneous match.\n"
    "\n"
    "    Match criteria values may be forced to be considered string by enclosing\n"
    "    the value in double quotes (\"). String values containing white space\n"
    "    must be encliosed in double quotes. For string matches, the case is\n"
    "    significant.\n"
    "\n"
    "    The third field is any program or script that is normally available to\n"
    "    the user. If a relative path name is specified, this is relative to the\n"
    "    directory in which kryten was started, and not to the configuration file.\n"
    "    If a path name is not specified, then the usual PATH environment search\n"
    "    rules apply.\n"
    "\n"
    "    The program or script should expect four parameters, namely:\n"
    "        the PV name,\n"
    "        the match status (i.e. 'entry' or 'exit'),\n"
    "        the current PV value, and\n"
    "        the element number.\n"
    "\n"
    "    The program or script is only invoked when the match status changes.\n"
    "    If a PV disconnects then the program or script is called with a\n"
    "    'disconnect' status and the value parameter is an empty string.\n"
    "\n"
    "    The program or script is run in background mode, and therefore it will\n"
