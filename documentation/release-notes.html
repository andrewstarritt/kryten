<h1>Release Notes</h1>

<h2>kryten-2.2.2</h2>
Updated e-mail address and copyright dates.
No function chage.
 <p>

<h2>kryten-2.2.1</h2>
kryten is now built as a regular application in its own top directory as opposed to as 
an EPICS extension. There are no new features for this release, but there is one minor bug 
fix, i.e. the -V option now recognised; and a few typos fixed as well.
 <p>

<h2>kryten-2.1.7</h2>
Several new features for this release.
<p>
Introduced the --monitor, -m option that allows the configuration "file" to be specified as
as single command line argument to kryten.
<p>
Mainly to support the command line configuration specification, multiple channel monitoring
specifications can be specified on one line, separated by a semi-colon (;) symbol.
<p>
Added a builit in quit command that terminates kryten. This takes an option intergere parameter
that can be used as the exit code.
<p>
A channel monitoring specification value can now be qualified with "&gt;=", "&gt;", "&lt;", "&lt;=" and "/=".
The previously implied "=" qualifier may now also be explicit.
<p>
Exit codes from sig int and sig term are now the same as if these signals were not caught.
<p>
These may all be combined thus:
<pre>
   kryten -m "SR11BCM01:CURRENT_MONITOR  &lt; 180.0 quit 6 ; SR11BCM01:LIFETIME_MONITOR  &lt; 16.0 quit 8"
</pre>
kryten will run until either the first PV drops below 180.0 or the second drops below 16.0 and will terminate
with exit code 6 or 8 respectively.
<p>

<h2>kryten-2.1.6</h2>
Cosmetic fixes - tidied up the help info.
<p>

<h2>kryten-2.1.5</h2>
Cosmetic fixes - proper colour reset, removal of double "the the" in output messages.
<p>

<h2>kryten-2.1.4</h2>
Included the EPICS base version as part of the kryten version.

<p>
Minor help info typo fixes.

<h2>kryten-2.1.3</h2>
The specified command may now be given optional arbtary parameters.
These include the format convertion characters %p, %e, %m and %v
corresponding to PV name, element index, match status and value respectively.

<p>
The match status is now 'match'/'reject' - was previously 'entry'/'exit'.

<p>
Revamped the kryten.html documentation file.

<p>
After 2 seconds <logo>kryten</logo> now issues connection timeout messages
for any channel that is not connected.

<p>
The format of some warning messages have been modified (essentially cosmetic).

<p>
Internal code re-organisation/rationalisation.

<h2>kryten-2.1.2</h2>

<logo>kryten</logo> terminates if the configuration file does not specify any PVs.

<p>
In verbose mode <logo>kryten</logo> outputs its interpretation of the configuration file.

<p>
This version is more tolerant when parsing te configuration file.
White space is now allowed between the sub-fields of the match criteria.
<font size="4"><pre>

# White space now allowed   -----+--+---+-+----+-+
#                                |  |   | |    | |
#                                v  v   v v    v v
SR11BCM01:LIFETIME_MONITOR   -1.0 ~  5.0 | 50.0 ~ 100.0    echo

# Whereas previously had to be like this:
#
SR11BCM01:LIFETIME_MONITOR   -1.0~5.0|50.0~100.0           echo

# end
</pre></font>

<p>
An optional index values may now be specified (for waveform and other array PVs).
The default is [1], which specifies the first element 
(<logo>kryten</logo> numbers array elements from 1 to N as oppossed to the C style 0 to N-1).
If there are less elements in the array than the specified index value then the PV is ignored.<br>
Example:
<font size="4"><pre>

# Monior the third element of the array for being a prime less than 32.
#
SOME_WAVEFORM:ARRAY [3]   2 ~ 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 | 13 | 17 | 19 | 23 | 31  /home/user/bin/prime.sh
</pre></font>

<p>
The command script or program should now expect four parameters - the (new) 4th parameter is
the element index.
<p>
Created this Release Notes file.
